# Welcome to Fake News Detection
Fake News Detection Mini-Project for SC1015 - Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence

## About
This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on the detection of fake news from this specific [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/fake-news-classification/data ). \ 
Since the dataset is too large, it cannot be uploaded to github but a sample OF first 5000 rows is provided.

## Contents
